Hi, I'm Kevin. I love building great products that provides not only value, but aesthetics to the user.
I'm a huge fans of taking photos and listening to heavy musics and going to gigs!

## What I've been working on
Currently I am working on an open-sourced app called Kontax Cam. It's an instant camera app for photographers with support of multiple custom effects and filters that you can mix-and-match.

## What i wanted to learn this year
- Blender (3D Graphics)
- Game design and development?!
